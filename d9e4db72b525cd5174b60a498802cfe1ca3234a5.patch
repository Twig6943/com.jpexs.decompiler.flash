 				<ul>
 					<li>AS1/2 - Single DoAction tag inside frame is now displayed directly as frame node so there is no longer need to expand frame nodes (useful for fast switching scripts)</li>
-					<li>AS1/2 - Scripts from default package (not these inside `__Packages`) are now exported/imported to/from main scripts folder instead of localized `<default package>` before. (Only happened when package flattening was on) This may break backwards compatibility. For importing scripts from older versions of FFDec, you should move the scripts from `<default package>` to main scripts folder.</li>
